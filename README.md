# DR_Annotate_FR

## About

This is a client side app that uses firebase to store json. Users can update, add, and remove annotations from chapter of a book.

## Known Issues & Notes
Adding annotations is a little buggy. The adding process isn't super intuitive. Version 2 will feature clear messages with data
binding to enhance user experience.

Some of the variables in the annotation controller are reduntant and need to be refactored.
